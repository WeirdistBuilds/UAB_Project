Thanks for calling us! It looks like Mr. Thomas is septic. We'll help you 
initiate the Sepsis Power Plan. What do you think we should do first?

If we do that, the blood samples we take won't show anything. I think that's wrong, we need to do something else first.

Their infection is the priority right now. I think that's wrong, we need to do something else first.

That's right! We better take the blood samples first before we start antibiotics and fluids. Great job!

MET incoming! Oh good, you've started the Sepsis Power Plan already! Now that you've drawn blood for cultures, we can help you start on antibiotics and fluids. Great job!

Alright, I'm going home!
This guy was admitted yesterday, so here's my report.
His name is Mr. Thomas, let's see, he's 30 years old, 70 kilograms, no known drug or food allergies, and he has anemia and melena.


Oh, also, he recently had an abscess on his left leg. he just completed a course of antibiotics, Bactrim.
He has a history of hypertension, and he takes Norvasc for his blood pressure.
Some of that is in the chart in case you need to check
Anyways, have a great shift!

Alright, I'm back! How did it go with Mr. Thomas?
